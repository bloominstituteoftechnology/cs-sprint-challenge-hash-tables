# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your answers beforehand.

1. Hashing functions
2. Collision resolution
3. Performance of basic hash table operations
4. Load factor
5. Automatic resizing
6. Various use cases for hash tables

We expect you to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade.


### MVP

- [x] Solve any three of the five problems
- [x] Implement your solution in the `.py` skeleton file
- [x] Make sure your code passes the tests running the test script with make tests

*Note: For these exercises, we expect you to use Python's built-in `dict` as a hashtable. That said, if you wish, you can attempt to solve using your own hashtable implementation, as well. All solutions should utilize a `dict` or hashtable. You should not use Sets. (Though you can make a `dict` behave like a set if you wish.)*


### Stretch

- [ ] Solve any four of the five problems
- [ ] Solve all five problems
