    Given a package with a weight limit limit and a list weights of item
    weights, finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit.

    Returns a tuple of integers where each element represents the item weights
    of the two packages. The higher-valued index is placed in the zeroth index
    and the smaller index is placed in the first index. If such a pair doesnâ€™t
    exist for the given inputs, returns None.
