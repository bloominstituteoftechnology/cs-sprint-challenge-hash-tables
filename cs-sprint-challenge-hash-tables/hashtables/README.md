# Hash Tables Sprint Challenge

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working
through some algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved
efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point.
Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the
exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the `.py`
skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the
test script with `-v`.


## Hint

Remember: the hashtable key should be the thing you want to search
quickly on! The value is what you want to get back from that search.
